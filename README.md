# Library Management System API

## Project Overview

The **Library Management System API** is a backend API that helps manage library resources such as books, authors, and users. This system allows users to search, borrow, and return books, while also enabling library admins to manage the library's inventory. The project provides a RESTful API that interacts with a PostgreSQL database and is built using TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, and Prisma ORM for database management.

- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that provides static typing, making the code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for building the API.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of API routes and server management.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database used to store library data, such as books, users, and loans.
- **Prisma ORM**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool used to interact with the PostgreSQL database.

### Packages

- `express`: Web framework for Node.js
- `typescript`: TypeScript language support
- `prisma`: ORM for database interaction
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file
- `ts-node`: TypeScript execution environment for running TS code directly
- `cors`: Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
